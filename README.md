Hey there! This is a simple HTML webpage for a beauty product store. Let me break down what's happening:

1. **HTML Structure:** We've got the usual HTML setup. The `<head>` holds metadata and styles, and the `<body>` has all our content.

2. **CSS Styling:** I added some basic styles right into the HTML using inline styles. This covers the look of the body, header, container, carousel, product cards, and shopping cart. The goal is a clean and responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes.

3. **JavaScript for Carousel:** There's a bit of JavaScript for a basic image carousel with previous and next buttons. It makes the images change on their own and lets you navigate manually.

4. **Featured Products Section:** Look for a section showing off some featured beauty products. Each product card includes an image, product name, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.

5. **Shopping Cart Section:** I've added a simple shopping cart area. It lists the items you've added and their prices, with the total cost at the bottom.

**Why I Did What I Did:**

- **Keeping it Simple:** This is meant to be beginner-friendly. The code is straightforward and easy to play around with – great for learners and those new to web development.

- **Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** No fancy frameworks here. We're keeping it light and focusing on the basics. It's perfect for smaller projects or learning environments where simplicity is key.

- **Responsive Design:** I used media queries in the CSS to make sure the webpage looks good on different screens. You know, it's all about giving users a nice experience no matter what device they're on.

- **Inline Styles:** While pros might use external stylesheets, I kept it simple with inline styles in the HTML. It makes everything self-contained in one file.

- **Image Carousel Magic:** The JavaScript carousel is a basic setup. No external plugins – just a good understanding of how carousels work and a foundation for customizing it later.
